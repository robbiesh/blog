Shopify's Timber used to have a great slideout AJAX cart, but there isn't one in Debut â€“ so I pulled the pieces together from there and [put it all in one file here](https://gist.github.com/robbiesh/e4aa65cd175ddcdb131b46a7ae7b30d6). Just add this in a snippet, include the snippet in the bottom of theme.liquid right above the </body>, and it should automatically work in Debut.
